<p>Winning a championship is one of the hardest feats in sports. All the time practicing, training in the gym, and grinding it out into the season, just for a chance to raise the trophy at the end of it all. Now take it a step further and try to defend that title with the same exact team. Sounds easy enough, but for the 2019 Boston Red Sox it did not go according to plan. From beating their franchise record with 108 wins and a title to their name, to finishing 3rd in the AL East and missing the postseason. Let’s dive deeper into the difference between their 2018 season to their 2019.</p>

<p>The first dataset I will be working with is the all MLB team’s hitting stats for the 2018 season.</p>
<p>I first filtered out the Boston Red Sox, so I could have them separate from the rest when I used my bubble chart.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>redsoxh18&lt;- teambatting18%&gt;% filter(Tm==&quot;BOS&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then I also went a summarize the team’s hits and runs scored so I could use their averages as the vertical and horizontal lines.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>teambatting18%&gt;%
  summarise(
    hits= mean(H),
    runs= mean(R)

<p>I first wanted to answer how well did the Boston Red Sox offense preformed during their record setting season. To answer that I created a bubble chart comparing hits and runs scored of all 30 MLB teams with the size being the number of wins they had.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot() +

Boston stands alone clearly showing that they were the best offense in the Majors. Leading the league both in hits and runs scored, that will definitely win you a lot of games in baseball.</p>
<p>Now how did the 3rd placing Red Sox do in the 2019? I looked into the 2019 season totals for the MLB teams again.</p>

Surprisingly, the Boston Red Sox are still amoung the best three offensive teams in baseball. Despite having a 84-78 record and a missed Wild Card spot into the playoffs.</p>
<p>Now let’s change gears and look to see if pitching was a struggle for Boston in 2019. First let’s see how they did during their historic 2018 season.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>teampitching18&lt;- read_csv(&quot;~/SPMC 350/Brandon_Warnke_Create_Blog/content/post/2021-04-21-the-red-sox-world-series-hangover/MLB_Team_Stats_2018_Pitching.csv&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>I wanted to see how the Red Sox pitching performed during 2018 when it comes to hits and runs allowed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>redsoxp18&lt;-teampitching18%&gt;% filter(Tm==&quot;BOS&quot;)

From the graphic above you can see that Boston is towards the league average. However, they are still in the best quadrant allowing less hits and runs then the average for the league.</p>
<p>Now how did the 84-78 team do pitching wise during the 2019 season.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>teampitching19&lt;- read_csv(&quot;~/SPMC 350/Brandon_Warnke_Create_Blog/content/post/2021-04-21-the-red-sox-world-series-hangover/MLB_Team_Stats_2019_Pitching.csv&quot;)</code></pre>

From the looks of it you can see that the Red Sox did not perform as well in this season as the 2018 one. They are towards the upper right meaning they are among the worst performing teams when it comes to pitching.</p>
<p>After looking at this I wanted to see the starting pitchers performances for the Red Sox in both season.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SP&lt;- read_csv(&quot;~/SPMC 350/Brandon_Warnke_Create_Blog/content/post/2021-04-21-the-red-sox-world-series-hangover/MLB_SP_2018.csv&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>I went and took all the pitchers in the MLB and made a dataframe from them. Next I filtered so I could get actually starters and not relievers. So I made it so only pitchers with 100 plus innings pitch could qualify.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>realsp&lt;-SP%&gt;%filter(IP&gt;=100)</code></pre>
<p>Next I made a separate one so it took the Boston starters so I could highlight them on the scatterplot. Then I made a scatterplot to show performances based on runs allowed and hits allowed with the average of both as a linear line.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>starters&lt;- realsp%&gt;% filter(Name== &quot;

As you can see the five starters really performed well. Especially the dot at the bottom left, which was Chris Sale. Sale had a award running season. He place fourth in Cy Young voting with a 2.11 ERA, 12 wins, and 237 strike outs.</p>
<p>Now let’s see if the below average performance in 2019 was due to the starters.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SP19&lt;- read_csv(&quot;~/SPMC 350/Brandon_Warnke_Create_Blog/content/post/2021-04-21-the-red-sox-world-series-hangover/MLB_SP_2019.csv&quot;)</code></pre>

As you can see the starters for Boston are now in the middle towards the league average instead of being below that line.</p>
<p>Being compared to the league the Sox show they haven’t downgraded in terms of crucial stats to win games. However, how did they fair against their AL East Rivals?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>aleast&lt;- teambatting19%&gt;% filter(Tm== &quot;BOS&quot;|Tm==&quot;NYY&quot;|Tm==&quot;BAL&quot;|Tm==&quot;TBR&quot;|Tm==&quot;TOR&quot;)

<p><img src="/2021/04/21/the_red_sox_world_series_hangover/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="672" />
From both of these bar charts you can see that Boston was 2nd in both runs scored and allowed in the AL East.</p>
<p>After looking at everything it seems the Red Sox in 2019 did not improve or even performed the same as they did in the previous season. Dealing with their ace Chris Sale leaving the season early with a injury and having Nathan Eovaldi leaving after 4 starts also with an injury. As well as having the Yankees winning 103 games, and the Rays having a 97 win second place finish. Did not help the Red Sox one bit.</p>
